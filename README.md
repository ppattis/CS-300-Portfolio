# CS-300-Portfolio


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem was the storage, searching, and printing of a catalog of university courses, read in from a csv file.

How did you approach the problem?

I approached the problem using a Binary Search Tree to store the courses.  I used a BST because the courses would already be sorted just by being added to the tree.

How did you approach any roadblocks you encountered?

Google-fu.  I am quite proficient with getting the answers to roadblocks from google and stackexchange.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing softwareand developing programs?

This project has given me a deeper understanding of the BST and its uses.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think that work on this project has continued to teach me the value of commenting code.
